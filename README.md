# hello-world
Setting up the GitHud repository
I am a 25+ year programmer mainly in the IBM environment (AS/400, iSeries). Half of my career has been in the manufacturing arena. I love my job because it allows me to create things other people can use to make their work easier to perform. I also like to troubleshoot things to resolve problems in software and businesses.
